💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
🧠 Project Overview
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to detect fraudulent transactions from a credit card transaction dataset. The objective is to classify whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, based on anonymized transaction features.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Size: 284,807 transactions

Classes:

0: Legitimate

1: Fraudulent

Features:

28 anonymized principal components (V1 to V28)

Time, Amount

Class (Target)

💡 Note: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only ~0.17% of transactions labeled as fraud.

🔍 Objectives
Build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression.

Handle class imbalance using under-sampling, over-sampling, or SMOTE.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (since accuracy alone is misleading).

Apply feature scaling to improve model convergence.
